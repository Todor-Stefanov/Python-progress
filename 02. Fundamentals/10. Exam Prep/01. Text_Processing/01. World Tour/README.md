_You are a world traveler, and your next goal is to make a world tour. To do that, you have to plan out everything first. To start with, you would like to plan out all of your stops where you will have a break._  

On the first line, you will be given a string containing all of your stops. Until you receive the command **"Travel"**, you will be given some commands to manipulate that   initial string. The commands can be:   

-	**"Add Stop:{index}:{string}"**:  
    -	Insert the given string at that index only if the index is valid
- **"Remove Stop:{start_index}:{end_index}"**:  
    - Remove the elements of the string from the starting index to the end index (inclusive) if both indices are valid
-	**"Switch:{old_string}:{new_string}"**:
    - If the old string is in the initial string, replace it with the new one (all occurrences)  
                
Note: After each command, print the current state of the string if it is valid!  
After the **"Travel"** command, print the following: **"Ready for world tour! Planned stops: {string}"**    

#### Input / Constraints  
-	An index is valid if it is between the first and the last element index (inclusive) (0 â€¦.. Nth) in the sequence.
#### Output
-	Print the proper output messages in the proper cases as described in the problem description
